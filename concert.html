A group of musicians connected to the Dryden schools are coming together
to help out a new local community organization.  "Concert for the
Caf&eacute;," featuring Hall Pass, Beyond Measure, and The Small Kings,
will take place Saturday, January 12, at 7 p.m. in the Dryden High
School/Middle School Auditorium.

All three of the bands playing at the benefit concert have connections to
the school.
<b>Beyond Measure</b> is Dryden High School's award winning student a
capella group, led by director Sandy Duncan, with the assistance of Nancy
