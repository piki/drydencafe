<h1>Dryden Community Center Cafe Grand Opening to Benefit Local Food
Pantries</h1>

<p>
The public is invited to bring a non-perishable food item
to Dryden Community Center Cafe's Grand Opening on Friday, March 28 to
benefit three local food pantries: Dryden Kitchen Cupboard, Freeville Food
Pantry and McLean Community Church.

<p>
    "We feel having the local food pantries benefit from our Grand Opening
is a perfect way to celebrate the sense of community the cafe represents,
while helping out a most worthy cause," said Monica Knight, cafe vice
president. "This is just one of many ways in which we intend to contribute
to the community."

<p>
    Grand Opening festivities will begin at noon with a symbolic ribbon
cutting ceremony attended by Dryden village and town officials, followed
by a variety of kids' events from 4 to 6 p.m., including a coloring
contest, face painting and sports team sign ups; after school teen music
from 3 to 5 p.m., and the Ithaca New Orleans Dixieland Band from 7 to 9
p.m. Throughout the day there will be hourly coupon giveaways for free
food items. Food and beverages specials will include free coffee samples,
$1 ice cream cones and "lottery cupcakes" (buy a cup cake and if yours has
a cream filling, you win a free combo meal).

<p>
    Dryden Community Center Cafe represents a significant step toward what
organizers, members and donors hope will contribute to a reawakening of
Dryden Village's Main Street, by creating a place for people to sit back,
relax and enjoy good food and drink, local musicians on the stage, local
artists on the walls and an eclectic calendar of community member-
organized events. The goal has been to create a casual, comfortable and
friendly atmosphere. This gathering place for the community will also
provide free WiFi access in a computer-friendly environment.

<p>
    Dryden Community Center Cafe is located at 1 West Main Street, in
Dryden Village. The cafe <a href="menu.html">menu</a> offers specialty
coffees, roasted locally by Coffee Mania, paninis, salads, soups, ice
cream and freshly made in-house treats. Cafe <a
href="hours.html">hours</a> are Wednesday through Saturday, 8 a.m. to 9
p.m., Sunday 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.
